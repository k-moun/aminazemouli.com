        <p> Blender animation</p>
        <p> I had the opportunity to work with a local artist on delivering an animation for an exhibition she had during Dutch Design Week 2024. 
        It was the first time that I worked with Blender. I got the opportunity to learn 
         from scratch while having the pressure of delivering the project within 2 months. I learned all the 
        basics of modeling in Blender, UV mapping, displacement modifiers, etc. It was  a great learning journey
        and I would like to explore more what this amazing software can offer. </p>

        <p> 3D modeling for 3D printing</p>
        <p> I had the opportunity to work with a 3D printing company on objects they wanted produce themselves. 
            They would send me the image (AI generated) of an object that I would have to 3D model so that it's 3D printed. 
            I mainly worked with Grasshopper, even when it wasn't the optimal software to challenge myself on woorking on my geometry logic. 
            While I was working on it, I had the chance to learn Blender, which made some tasks incredibly easier
            with its scultping tools.</p>

        <p> 3D printed Origami</p>
        <p> I worked on a script that allows me to make an origami lampshade. 
            I've always been fascinated by origami, I thought why not combine it with 
            Grasshopper and 3D printing. I tried printing it with a vase mode and without
            by playing with the thickness. </p>

        <p> 3D printed hand brace</p>
        <p> I participated in a challenge for 3D modeling a hand brace. 
            It was organized by a company that scans hands of patients with an injury or pain 
            in their hands then 3D models a suitable brace for them. The brace is obviously too big 
            for my hand because it was modeled based on a patient's hand. 
            It was a great challenge. I worked with SUBD in Rhino to make the shape based on the hand 
        then I used a voronoi script in Grasshopper to shape it in a way that it becomes breathable. It looks quite cool</p>
